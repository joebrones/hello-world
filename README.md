Yet another repo

Hello, my name is Joe and I'm interested in using technology in education.
I want to make recommendation apps for matching students with instrucors in a network of instructors and student masters
Essentialy there will be three or four components:
  1. An Agent which monitors the education level of a student, profiles their strengths and weaknesses using daily monitoring of homework and tests.  The agent incorporates spaced repetition coaching and a goal of 100% understanding before progressing to the next topic.  Pace of education in a topic would depend on how quickly the student takes to it.  Education vector path and branches would be mapped.
  
  2. A server back end for their in person teacher who will better be able to foster the students education and report back to their parents their real time progress video game style.

  3.  A distributed automonous corporation which uses cryptocurrency to transfer value to the most effective teachers.  The different roles in this system would be students, and teachers.  The content would be lessons.  As soon as a student passes the teacher's test and is certified by the instructor, more crypto is generated and the student becomes a master of the material, they are then allowed to teach the same material in the network.
  4.  A parent coachining and informing app

  This system will help answer the question why am I learning this?  And how does it link back into what I know? because they will be taught at the moment the student needs them for what they are interested in.
  
  Uses their interests as motivation and recommends courses of action based on available education paths.
    Key education upgrade here would be:  early detection of non learning or incomplete understanding of the corpus of knowledge
    Notification to available students who have mastered the topics, opening a session to instantly connect them with an internet of available instructors in the next piece of the puzzle.  I basically want to propose a global network wher
